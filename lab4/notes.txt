Interact with dish
    cd ugradio/ugradio_code  # Will be set up for global access
    import dish
    d = dish.Dish()
    d = dish.Dish(verbose)  # Spits out lotsa things

    d.point -- if validate=True, it won't point, just tell you if it works or
    doesn't work.
        (consider checking for a ValueError...)
        point only returns control, once done pointing
        az, alt must be in degrees

    d.home() -- returns it to point it straight up, resets encoders

    d.noise_on(), d.noise_off() -- turns on/off a "noise diode"
    Use noise diode for a Y-factor measurement.  Want to measure brightness
    temperature -- essentially a calibration.
    We will want to do noise calibrations every ~10 minutes or so, depending
    on observing strategy.

    Scripts: start by re-homing, and turning off noise diode.

Set LO frequency
    import dish_synth
    s = dish_synth.Synth()  # Interface to the synthesizer
    s.set_freq(1420)  # Value in MHz...
    
    Maybe choose to get only positive frequencies.  What's the bandwidth of our
    spectrometer?

    We run signal in, mix with LO, run through sampler @ 24 MHz.
    So we get 12 MHz bandwidth (looking at positive frequencies only).
    Line centered at 1420 MHz...  set LO lower, to get pos. freqs.
    Set it two bandwidths below, to take advantage of aliasing to get spectrum.

    set LO to 1390 MHz... (?!)

Take data
    import takespec
    takespec.takeSpec()

    Don't use default # of spectra, that takes like 1/3rd second/spectrum.
    Our example: 32 spectra <-> 1 MB data.
    Data in binary format.

Read data (do on own computer)
   import readspec_mod
   d = readspec_mod.readSpec('firsttry0.log')
   We get 8192 * (number of spectra) numbers, covering
   the bandwidth of our spectrum (1414-1426 MHz)

   Data are SPIKY -- due to radio interference!
   Little bump on the data -- that's our galaxy flipping us the finger.

CHECK EVERYTHING
    Maximal number of things that could go wrong...
    make sure it does what you expect...



Division of labor...
--------------------
Divide and conquer for data acquisition and reduction
Telescope control
    Homing, pointing, coordinate conversion
    Data collection, frequency control, noise control.
Scientific goals
    Where to point, what frequencies to look at
    Raw data --> science data, spectra clean-up / RFI removal, etc

Noise management -- main curve is intrinsic to telescope/electronics
Can move the HI signal around, by changing frequency band we're looking at
Keep signal in right place in band???

One person download at a time.
Collecting ~ 1000 spectra at a time.
10 hours observations --> 3 hours download!!!
Internet management -- how to make it robust when things are falling apart
Lots of connection failures...
You should be using screen to run your observations, so observations won't be
killed if internet fails.
Plot sparingly on Heiles... very little bandwidth

Leuschner -- bandwidth is 4 deg., do 2 deg. spacings?

Telescope best tuned to 1270?! (uhhhh not catching quite everything)
1570 is at your own risk

Remember what you've already observed...

---------------------

Point to (l,b) = (120, 0) degrees -- we expect to see 3 spiral arms, 3
redshifts.  This point has high declination so should be usually observable.
Should take ~1 minute to get a good spectrum out.

Not so much noise as gain fluctuation (cf. NRAO radiometer thing?)
Just take noise for each pointing

Refine pointings as needed.  Probably 5 minutes for final data....

~3 MHz separation for on/off frequencies
10 MHz worth of useful bandwidth
(can't go too far, stuff gets lost in wings -- why do we want two online
spectra just shifted, exactly?)

150 = 144 + 6 (keep the spectra in the middle for the sampling)

How did we get a signal out, still, at 1390 MHz LO?

SUN?!  RA, dec is about 2h, 12 degrees.
Moon -- moves more.  Figure it out.

Noise: how does Y-factor measurement work?!
    So we have two knobs -- LO freq, and noise diode on/off
    We want to correct for bandpass shape g(nu)
    T_noise = ~100 Kelvin

    Looking at signals: P_brown (LO1), P_red (LO2), P_blue (LO2 + noise)
    P_blue - P_red = g(nu) T_noise
    integrate

    1/8192, due to averaging process -- so noise won't be too bad.
    Keep it ~10% of maximum error we expected, so it's not important
    (Karto: we're losing edge channels, and have to remove RFI spikes)
    (thus, more like 1/sqrt(4000) noise)


Noise in upper sideband is slightttly better?!?!?!
    (5 minutes/pt for magellanic cloud)
    (rest, ~1 min/pt?)
    (CHECK THIS FOR ALL GROUPS)

    Big maps: start with center, then wrap around in a spiral perhaps
    (get the brightest pts first this way, usually)

Aaron Parsons going over lab reports

Don't use the matplotlib offsets (super annoying)
Remember: you should be able to read abstract, figure captions
and come away with the main gist of the paper

Check-ins:

Logarithmic units are nice way to visualize multiplication:
log(g1 * sig) = log(g1) + log(sig)
log(g2 * sig) = log(g2) + log(sig)


Features to extract from spectra
-- profile (maximum/center, width)
-- amount of stuff (sum/integrate spectra -- characterize RMS of noise,
    perhaps and then apply, say, a threshold.... or anisotropic diffusion :|
        This by nature introduces a bias -- from cutting the signal down
        (not integrating over entire domain)


Now to generate nice plots from data...
    we have lots of little points (x, y, intensity)
    idea: we could convolve our data with some function (boxcar, 2-D gaussian)
    Pick a "kernel".  Then this will give us a smoothed version.
    But, we will lose the amplitude due to smoothing.  How do we fix this?

    Idea: run kernel over data (gives 'img_smooth')
    Run kernel over an impulse representation of data (gives 'wgt_smooth')
    Then, take img_smooth / wgt_smooth to recover the expected shape.

    img[some pt] = m1 * w1 + m2 * w2 + m3 * w3
    wgt[some pt] = w1 + w2 + w3

    img_smooth/wgt_smooth = \sum_i w_i m_i / \sum_i w_i

==================
Karto (4/30/2014):
spectral analysis
==================

    moment 0 - constant (sum of intensities)
    moment 1 - multiply each channel by doppler velocity, then sum...
    moment 2 - dispersion around mean, sum (channel - mean veloc)^2 (?)

        moment maps -- with appropriate weights (sum of intensities or w/e)

    idea -- doppler veloc. tells us about opening angle... if we ASSUME a
    spherical shell or something.

    Can't really constrain physical temperature

    Integral of spectrum gives us a COLUMN DENSITY

    Displaying images:
    color channels (RGB), brightness
    (idea: dispersion - color, brightness - intensity)

    Information that would be interesting...
    looking @ line broadening mechanisms -- just look @ one spectrum.
    is shock supersonic/subsonic (estimate T, rho of ISM)
    bubble is probably in snowplough phase...
