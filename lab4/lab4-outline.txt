Introduction
    -- Astrophysics of the North Polar Spur
        * Shape, form, research
    -- HI line (hyperfine transition, strength, physical processes probed)
        * Definition, physical process, Einstein A, compare to quantity of HI
        * Observed strength
        * Physical significance of neutral HI gas in the galaxy
    -- Questions that can be addressed with HI?
        * shock history, shape, ISM interaction

Observations
    -- Leuschner dish (hardware, signal processing chain)
        * Dish specs
        * LO mixing
        * Output spectra, spectral resolution (compare to HI line)
    -- Observing campaign
        * Galactic coordinates -- definition for reference
        * Size and dates of region mapped
        * Galactic coordinates, and (RA, dec) for comparison
        * Regions unmappable
        * Mapping technique (Isaac zig-zags across the sky)

Data reduction
    -- RFI removal
        * Sources of RFI
        * Removal procedure
    -- Calibration procedure
        * Gain correction
        * Converting power (units?!) to temperature (i.e. calibrate scale)
        * Merging spectra (combine integration times)

Data analysis
    -- Baseline removal, peak identification
    -- Computation of n-th moments, column density, et cetera
    -- Error analysis
        * Explain why we chose particular integration times
    -- Map projections used
        * Sinusoidal, Mollweide, Hammer-Aitoff, stereographic, orthographi

Results
    -- PRETTY PICTURES YAY
    -- Qualitative features.  Discussion of numbers (magnitude/ranges).
    -- Look at example spectra (at least one in region of high dispersion)

Discussion
    -- Additional science, scientific interpretation, ISM/shock shape

Future work
    -- Better ways to mitigate RFI
    -- Better calibration methods
        * RFI removal method that doesn't throw away 3/4 points
    -- Better understanding of bubble shape, Gaussian fitting, etc.
    -- NEW LEUSCHNER DISH MUCH FUN SO EXCITE VERY DATA.

Conclusion
    -- Uhhh.
