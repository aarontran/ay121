Week 1 data
-----------

1.1 - Resistive voltage divider
    Used 2 10k resistors
    V_in = 6.13 V
    V_out = 3.05 V
    I = 0.30 mA

    Applied 10 MHz sine wave
    With 10k resistors, only got ~0.7 Vpp
    With 1.2k resistors, got ~2.5 Vpp
    (forgot what Vpp we put in, order of 1-5 Vpp)

1.2 - Capacitive voltage divider
    Used two 2 nF capacitors (103G, 2%)
    Even as $f \to 0$, Vout/Vin remains the same
    
    Vin = 4.9 V, Vout = 2.48 V, f = 1 kHz
    Vin = 3.84 V, Vout = 1.94 V, f = 1 MHz
    
    If we add a 1k resistor to ground at the output
    The gain, assuming identical caps, becomes:
    1/(2 + 1/ (j\omega R C) ) where j is imaginary unit

1.3 - RC filters
    Looks good.  150 kOhm and 10 nF to get 100 kHz cut-offs

1.4 - LC filters
    We use L = 1 microH, C = 22 nF, R = 33 ohm (RLC bandpass)

1.5 - Diodes
    Vdiode = [0.64, 0.718, 0.649, 0.669, 0.583, 0.533, 0.486]
    R = [1000, 220, 820, 560, 3300, 10000, 27000]

1.6 - FM demodulator
    ghost signal.  Need to add DC bias to match diode knee voltage
    somewhat resolved/explained away... circuit acting as an antenna
    LRC: same values as for 1.4, maybe slightly different in rebuilt version
    blocking cap = whatever?
    diode biasing circuit: 6.3 kohm, 1 kohm
    after the diode = RC low pass, 15 ohm and 100 nF
    
    Here we ran into the problem that our thing seemed to flatline, when
    debugging with scope probe.  One issue: diode response time, which was
    improved by playing with resistors... but. ?!


Week 2 data
-----------

2.2 Transmission lines
    \Delta t = 25 ns, using square waves
    \Delta l ~ 4 meters, giving ~ 1.6e8 m/s

2.3 Follower circuit
    R_1 = 17.3 kohm, R_2 = 31 kohm (biasing voltage divider @ base)
    C_1 ~ 0.66 microfarad, C_2 ~ 1 microfarad (C_1 at V_in, C_2 at V_out)
    R_E = 2.5 kohm
    ignored last resistor since that was basically a load resistor?
    
    In practice values were slightly different
    Required a decoupling cap. to remove parasitic oscillations
    Required scope probe / proper termination on input, to see right voltages
    
    V_base = 3.1 V, V_emitter = 2.5 V, V_BE = 0.6 V as expected
    
    10 kHz sine.  Can pass 5 V_pp fine.  At 5.5 V_pp, begin to see clipping
    (i.e. we could send through more than we expected?!)
    
    we did NOT play with how small we could make the emitter resistor!

2.4 Amplifier
    ACTUAL, STATED (not meausred) VALUES FOLLOW (unlike some other numbers)
    C_1 = 0.68 microfarad (at V_in)
    R_1 = 22 kohm, R_2 = 12 kohm 
    R_E = 1.5 kohm
    R_C = 2.7 kohm
    
    Input 100 mV Vpp sine, f = 10 kHz
    Output 174 mV Vpp (inverted, as expected)

    V_collector = 2.94 V, Vcc = 5V
    V_emitter = 1.12 V, V_base = 1.74 V

    Maximum sine amplitude
    V_in = 0.98 Vpp, V_out = 1.74 Vpp (looks okay)
    V_in = 1.4 Vpp, V_out = 2.34 Vpp (begins to clip, at bottom of signal)
    (flat clip, no inverting or anything).
    (at this V_in, I measured V_b ~ 2.4V, V_c ~ 1.8V -- implies very
    small voltage difference across transistor? not sure...

    Improve gain by adding capacitor
    Using stated resistor values 2.7 kohm, 1.5 kohm (collector/emitter)
    I calculate 58 nanofarad to get a gain of 10 at f = 10kHz
    Use 2 0.1 microfarad in series
    Test (10 kHz): V_in = 0.99 mV, V_out = 808 mV
    Test (20 kHz): V_in = 0.99 mV, V_out = 1.56 mV

Week 3 data
-----------

3.1 Gain for resistor noise
    Cougar Components AC1068C amplifier (Vcc = +15 V)
    24.5 dB gain below ~ 1.2 GHz (look up datasheet)
    All dead?!...

3.1 Resistor temperature
    Used 39 ohm resistors rated for 2 W
    Set voltage to 8.8 V
    Measurements (temp is generally to +/- 5 F?)
        8.8 V, 300 F
        7.0 V, 220 F
        5.0 V, 150 F
    Procedure: held probe as close to resistor as possible
    moved up/down to maximize temp. reading
