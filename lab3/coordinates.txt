A few notes on coordinate systems
March 4, 2014
=================================
Galactic (won't use)
Equatorial (RA, dec)
    z (up) = north pole (Polaris/Vega/whatevers)
    y = east (convention)
    x = awkwardly radially outwards
Topocentric (altitude, azimuth)
    z = up from your position on Earth
    x = east
    y = north

For convenience, use (RA, dec) (analogous to lat/lon) for equatorial coords

Topocentric
    Azimuth = start at north (y), rotate clockwise to measure
    Altitude = go upwards
    Nice and simple for telescope pointing

Some problems
-------------

Problem: Earth spins around + rotates around sun (need an extra bit of rotation
to make an object appear at the same place in the night sky.. er actually a
little less).
Described by sidereal time (86164 s -- common observatory password... [Keck?!])

Problem: precession/nutation.  Coordinates given for a particular epoch.
Then need to "precess" within current epoch -- precessing your coordinates

This week
---------
Use catalogs of sources to figure out where to point your telescope.
Write some rotations out manually, before letting pyephem do the hard work

Rotations
---------
SO(3) group structure <--> SU(2)
